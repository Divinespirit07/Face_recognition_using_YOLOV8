                                            Face_recognition_using_YOLOV8


This project develops a real-time human face detection and recognition system using YOLOv8, optimized for edge devices with limited computational resources. The system combines YOLOv8 for efficient face detection, Dlib for facial feature extraction and recognition, and OpenCV for image processing, ensuring high-speed performance with minimal latency. A custom dataset was labeled using Label Studio and used to train the model, achieving a mAP@50 of 0.995, demonstrating strong detection accuracy. The system features a Tkinter-based GUI for user-friendly interaction, enabling seamless face registration and real-time recognition.
